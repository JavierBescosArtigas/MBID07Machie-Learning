# MBID07Machie-Learning
PR1 and PR2 of Machine learning course. Maybe, when finished, I will save here my CherryTree notes.
* Pr1 and PR2 use Dengue Dataset from an online resource.
* Data is introduced in the notebook linking my google drive account, anyway the dataset is shared in this repo so if I have to come back and deleted/moved datasets from drive folder, easily solved.
